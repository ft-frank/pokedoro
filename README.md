Project Diary and Notes

19/1/25 - 

Created project on git and cloned to my ubuntu terminal with git.
Used Claude to code my frontend, including the pixel art, css etc. This involved the charmander, bulbasaur and squirtle screens.
Code was too messy, refactored the logic of creating the pixel art into separte js files that were to be imported
, so that I could easily add more pokemon later on. 
Uploaded to github pages, wasn't working properly

20/1/25 - 

Fixed the github pages problem, the link to bulbasaur js was without a . at the front of './bulbasaur.js'
Added pikachu theme. Thanks to my work from yesterday, this only took 5 - 10 minutes to ship (using claude code to help create the theme itself ofc)
